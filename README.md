# Three_Phase_Plot
Python code to plot Ternary equilibrium phase diagrams
 
 ## Packages
This python code can be use to plot three component equilibrium system in a ternary plots. This is done by utilizing the python package [`ternary`](https://github.com/marcharper/python-ternary). This package specializes in making triangle graphs/digrams and warps a lot of functions commonly found in [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/).

## Data
The limonene+water+methanol data was taken from the paper titled *Mutual Solubilities of Terpene in Methanol and Water and Their
Multicomponent Liquid-Liquid Equilibria*. The limonene+water+ethanol data was taken form the paper titled *The influence of the temperature on the liquidâ€“liquid equlibria of the mixture limonene + ethanol + H2O*. The temperature at which the data was collected for the methanol system was 298.15 K and temperature at which the data was collected for the ethanol system was 303.15 K.
